This is a command line interface for launching Steam games. (Will expand in the future)

It is intended to:
    1. Cut down on the extremely high and unneccesary CPU usage by Steam.
    2. Look pretty.

If you really need all the power you can get and cut down on as much Steam overhead as possible,
then turn off Steam overlay within Steam.
